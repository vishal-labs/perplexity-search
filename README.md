### Introduction
This is a project that I keep on developing as i learn more of API and AI.

Right now, the functionality are listed below
- When run, this application takes in the user query
- Uses Perplexity Search API to get the most relevant URLs for the query
- Returns any 1 or the URL to the frontend.
- Adds the query along with the result to a database for future references. 



### Functionalities for future improvement
1. Connect a database to this application so that, whenever a new query is asked, it get's logged in the database
2. Run this entire setup on kubernetes by creating different pods and services to that pods(this will help my understanding of kubernetes services)
3. create user logins for retrieving past queries for that user. 


### Example showcase
