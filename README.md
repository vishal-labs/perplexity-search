This is a project that I keep on developing as i learn more of API and AI

Right now, the functionality are listed below
- When run, this application takes in the user query
- Uses Perplexity Search API to get the most relevant URLs for the query
- Returns any 1 or the URL to the frontend.


### Functionalities for future improvemetn
1. Connect a database to this application so that, whenever a new query is asked, it get's logged in the database
2. Run this entire setup on kubernetes by creating different pods and services to that pods(this will help my understanding of kubernetes services)
3. create user logins
